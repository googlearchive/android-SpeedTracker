Android Speed Tracker Sample
===================================

This sample uses the FusedLocation APIs of Google Play Services
on those devices that have a hardware GPS built in. In those
cases, this sample provides a simple screen that shows the
current speed of the device on the watch. User can set a speed
limit and if the speed approaches that limit, it changes the
color to yellow and if it exceeds the limit, it turns red. User
can also enable recording of coordinates and when it pairs back
with the phone, this data will be synced with the phone
component of the app and user can see a track made of those
coordinates on a map on the phone.
